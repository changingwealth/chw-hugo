## Key takeaways

---

**For professionals:** 

* If you do any kind of work in macroeconomics, finance, industrial organization, and development in general you need to start learning about **Adjusted Net Savings** (on page 150) as an objective measure of sustainability. Especially since this measure has been included in the World Development Indicators publication. 
* It promotes the idea that development is a process of building and managing a portfolio of assets (produced, natural, human, and institutional capital) through the concept of **comprehensive wealth**.
* Intangible wealth (institutional, human) is the most important component of intangible wealth for all countries.

**For policy makers:** 

One of the key findings is that if a country is rich in natural resources, having the right policy matters. And this policy should:

* Be efficient in the extraction of maximum rents.
* Have a system of taxes and royalties that allows the country to recover a significant amount of that rent.
* Be clear about reinvestment of resource rents in productive assets (at the country level).

Because as per capita wealth rises, the share of natural capital decreases and the returns to education can only be realized with better institutions, in part as a product of the reinvestment of resource rents. And so these countries cannot afford to just spend their resource rents in mere consumption if they want to increase their wealth.

## What is not measured is not managed

It was very important that our first review on this website was about _The Changing Wealth of Nations_, obviously not only because of the name, but because of what it represents for the understanding of wealth sustainability. The insights of this book may feel subtle in the grand scheme of things, but they underpin much of the latest work of including better performance measures at the institutions that make large-scale economic and financial decisions. 

And that's what we want to do here. We realize that the economy is part of a larger complex system and that we need to start paying attention to what is
