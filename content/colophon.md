Changing Wealth is built with the fabulous [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) static site engine and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/changingwealth/chw-hugo). Thanks to the wonderful community at [discuss.gohugo.io](http://discuss.gohugo.io) for the clever implementation solutions.

The main typeface is [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora), while [PT Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans) was used for the headings. Both are displayed using Google Fonts. 

Finally, most of the CSS is handled with [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com).
