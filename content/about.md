Changing Wealth chronicles developments in the understanding of all forms of wealth and helps professionals incorporate these advances in their economic, social, human, and environmental development work, through publication reviews and original content.

ChangingÂ Wealth is not about the numbers, even if we review technical publications and care very much about scientific rigor. We are more interested in linking ideas, uncovering patterns, and figuring out the general direction the economy, the environment, and society are moving towards. That is why our reviews should feel more like a conversation over coffee with the authors and less like the mere reporting of the numbers.

Please don't reproduce our reviews in their entirety without consent, but do feel free to quote fragments of any of them providing a link to the specific review in question and attribution to its author.
